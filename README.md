The project investigates predicting rice leaf disease using a deep learning model. The dataset
that was used consists of 5932 high-quality images. This dataset includes a wide range of images and
covers four different kinds of rice leaf diseases: Blast, Brown Spot, Tungro, and Bacterial Blight. The
purpose of this project is to build a deep learning model that predicts a rice leaf disease with high accuracy.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was built to classify images in one of the four classes. The model
consists of five convolutional blocks, a flattened layer and two dense layers. The modelâ€™s performance was
high with 0.97 accuracy. The study provides data exploration, data preprocessing, and results were
displayed. Overall, it shows how deep learning has a high performance in image classification tasks.
